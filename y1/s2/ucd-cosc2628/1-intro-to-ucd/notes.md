### Introduction to User Centred Design:

UCD is important in designing. Improves employability with working knowledge.

#### Nielsen's Components of Usability  
+ **Learnability:** How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?  
+ **Efficiency:** Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform the tasks?  
+ **Memorability:** When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?  
+ **Errors:** How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?  
+ **Satisfaction:** How pleasant is it to use the design?

#### Steve Krug's Attributes of Usability  
+ **Useful:** Does it do something people need done?  
+ **Learnable:** Can people figure out how to use it?  
+ **Memorable:** Do they have to relearn it each time they use it?  
+ **Effective:** Does it get the job done?  
+ **Efficient:** Does it do it with a reasonable amount of time and effort?  
+ **Desirable:** Do people want it?  
+ **Delightful:** Is using it enjoyable, or even fun?  

#### Note: Usability != UCD  
+ **Usability  is a result, goal, a field** (UE, UX)  
+ **UCD is a methodology**  
+ Usability is an outcome of UCD process  

##### Usability -> Human-Computer Interaction -> User-Centered Design -> User Experience -> Application  
+ **HCI** focuses specifically on humans interacting with computing products.  
+ **UCD** is a methodology used by developers and designers to ensure they're creating products that meets user's needs.  
+ **UX** is one of the many focuses of UCD. It includes the user's entire experience with the product, including physical and emotional reactions.

#### Usability ####  
Can be described as how well a product communicates with the user on **Learning** how to use it, **Engagement** on how to use it to acheive a task and **Empowerment** on how well the user understands the products role in acheiving their goal.  

#### Overall Process  
Identify goal -> (Identify requirements -> Personas and scenarios -> Wireframes -> Prototyping)  
Speak to users at every stage. May involve repeating of processes.  

We must analyze user behaviour!  

#### Why do we care?  
In particular for mobile apps but also generally speaking, there is a lot *competition* and *first impressions* go a long way. Quality is not limited to the IT factors of an app and its development lifecycle.  

##### Two examples of good usability  
+ **Facebook like button:** Simple, allows easy reactions online. The user feels like they are expressing themself, and a part of something without much input required.  
+ **Instagram:** Simpler UI and UX improved upon their competitors (Photobucket, Flickr, etc.)  
*Lessons to be learned are that people are lazy, and those who use different platforms have different behaviours.*

#### The idea is...  
We understand what the processes involved in UCD are *right now*.  
We put into practice what we learn via *theory*, *guidelines* and *lessons learned*.  
We understand the language, and take this into account whenever you are building anything, for clients or as a hobby.  

###### I don't build products, I build **experiences** by understanding not only users' needs but also the tech and design requirements meeting those needs.  

#### Users  
Users don't care about underlying issues and technical details. Not quite, they used to but the user population is growing. Importantly, they sometimes don't know what they want.  

**User-Centred Design** is a method to improve usability, removing as much guess work as possible with working from the perspective of the user whenever it is relevant to do so.  

**The goal is to** create a better user experience through continually working with users in understanding what works best.  

**Usability is everywhere.** The practice pervades itself in every tool and object you can see.  

**Usability is not just design.**  It is not about having a pretty website. The value of aeshetics change. Something can be flashy but difficult ot use. eg. Flash  

**Affordance:**  *All "action possibilities" latent in the environment, independent of an individual's ability to recgnize them, always in relation to agents (people or animals) and therefore dependent on their capabilities.* - James J. Gibson  

**Not a bug report,** more proactive. Listen, watch for and anticipate the user's needs. It is more a question of *why* and *not how*.

**UCD is not a waste of resources.** Designing appropriately will save time and money in the long run through less re-design and streamlined testing phases of development.

**Those commissioning the app also don't exactly know what they want.** What to do? Fight for the user!
