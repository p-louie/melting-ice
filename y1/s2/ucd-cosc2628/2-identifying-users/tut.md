###UCD Tutorial 1: Usability and Users  

**Concepts of usability:**  
Nielsen's Components of Usability:  
Learnability, Efficiency, Memorability, Errors, Satisfaction 

Steve Krug's Attributes of Usability:  
Useful, Learnable, Memorable, Efficient, Desirable, Delightful  

**Examples of bad usability:**  
Remotes on top of light switches. 
Kindle store content.  
Quora/Pinterest if not signed up display a pop up blocking out the webpage

**1. Last application/system with a poor UCD experience:**  
In my house when we had ceiling fans installed the electricians installed remotes in every room that control lights and the fans. It is essentailly an extra layer of switches that if integrated correctly would simplify everything but now we have almost useless switches on the wall and remotes more often than not next to them. 

Websites like Quora and Pinterest that require a user to sign up to see their content when a better option would be to ask a user to sign up or log in if they want to post/interact on the site. It pushes people to sign up but I wonder how many of those use any functionality of the site besides being able to see answers anyway.

**3. When should we involve users?**  
Users should be involved early. When an idea is conceived we can access users from competing services in order to tailor the experience for them and reduce time and money in re-designing in the long run.

**4. Take a look at Assignment 1:**  
Groups for the assignment will be formed in week 3.
